```

**Notes:**
- Requires JVM support for `jcmd Compiler.queue` (HotSpot/OpenJDK/SapMachine)
- Informational output only (no warning thresholds)
- Included in `status` command output

**Exit codes:** `0` = success (informational only)

## `processes`

Checks whether there are any processes running on the system that take a high amount of CPU.
Helpful to identify e.g. a virus scanner or other interfering processes that use more than 20% of the available CPU-time.

<!-- BEGIN help_processes -->
```
Usage: jstall processes [-hV] [--dump-count=<count>] [--interval=<interval>]
                        [--keep] [--intelligent-filter] [--full]
                        [--file=<replayFile>] [<targets>...]
Detect other processes running on the system that consume high CPU time
      [<targets>...]         PID, 'all', filter or dump files (or replay ZIP as
                             first argument)
      --dump-count=<count>   Number of dumps to collect, default is none
  -f, --file=<replayFile>    Replay ZIP file to analyze (works before or after
                             subcommand)
      --full                 Run all analyses including expensive ones (only for
                             status command)
  -h, --help                 Show this help message and exit.
      --intelligent-filter   Use intelligent stack trace filtering (collapses
                             internal frames, focuses on application code)
      --interval=<interval>  Interval between dumps, default is 5s
      --keep                 Persist dumps to disk
  -V, --version              Print version information and exit.
```
<!-- END help_processes -->

## `flame`

Generates a flamegraph using async-profiler.

<!-- BEGIN help_flame -->
```
Usage: jstall flame [-hV] [--output=<outputFile>] [--duration=<duration>]
                    [--event=<event>] [--interval=<interval>] [--open]
                    [<target>]
Generate a flamegraph of the application using async-profiler
      [<target>]               PID or filter (filters JVMs by main class name)
  -d, --duration=<duration>    Profiling duration (default: 10s), default is 10s
  -e, --event=<event>          Profiling event (default: cpu). Options: cpu,
                               alloc, lock, wall, itimer
  -h, --help                   Show this help message and exit.
  -i, --interval=<interval>    Sampling interval (default: 10ms), default is
                               10ms
  -o, --output=<outputFile>    Output HTML file (default: flame.html)
      --open                   Automatically open the generated HTML file in
                               browser
  -V, --version                Print version information and exit.

Examples:
  jstall flame 12345 --output flame.html --duration 15s
  # Allocation flamegraph for a JVM running MyAppMainClass with a 20s duration
  # open flamegraph automatically after generation
  jstall flame MyAppMainClass --event alloc --duration 20s --open
```
<!-- END help_flame -->

**Note:** Filter must match exactly one JVM. Uses [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler).

## `record`

<!-- BEGIN help_record -->
```
Usage: jstall record [-hV] [COMMAND]
Record all data into a zip for later analysis
  -h, --help       Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version    Print version information and exit.
Commands:
  create   Record all data into a zip for later analysis
  extract  Extract recording folder from ZIP into a folder
  summary  Print the README summary from a recording ZIP
```
<!-- END help_record -->

---

## `vm-vitals`

Shows VM.vitals output (if available on the target JVM, e.g. SapMachine).

<!-- BEGIN help_vm_vitals -->
```
(Run jstall vm-vitals --help for full usage)
```
<!-- END help_vm_vitals -->

---

## `gc-heap-info`

Shows GC.heap_info last absolute values and change between samples.

<!-- BEGIN help_gc_heap_info -->
```
(Run jstall gc-heap-info --help for full usage)
```
<!-- END help_gc_heap_info -->

---

## `vm-classloader-stats`

Shows VM.classloader_stats grouped by classloader type.

<!-- BEGIN help_vm_classloader_stats -->
```
(Run jstall vm-classloader-stats --help for full usage)
```
<!-- END help_vm_classloader_stats -->

---

## `vm-metaspace`

Shows VM.metaspace summary and trend.

<!-- BEGIN help_vm_metaspace -->
```
(Run jstall vm-metaspace --help for full usage)
```
<!-- END help_vm_metaspace -->
