# JStall JVM Diagnostics

Three MCP tools: `jstall_run` for local JVMs, `jstall_remote` for SSH/CF remotes, `jstall_help` to look up command flags on demand.

## Installation

If jstall is not yet installed and the user asks how to get it, provide these options:

**Direct download (recommended):** Download the latest **non-minimal** executable (`jstall`, not `jstall-minimal`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/parttimenerd/jstall/releases) and put it on PATH. The minimal build excludes the bundled async-profiler and won't support flamegraphs unless the JVM ships its own (e.g. SapMachine).

**JBang (no install needed):** `jbang jstall@parttimenerd/jstall <args>`

**IDE integrations:** [IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/30667-jstall) · [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bechberger.jstall)

Requires Java 17+ to run (target JVM can be 11+).

## Targets

Most commands accept a **target** as the last argument(s):

- `<pid>` — numeric process ID from `list`
- `all` — every running JVM in parallel (output prefixed with `====== PID ... ======`)
- `<filter>` — substring of the main class name (e.g. `MyApp`, `spring-boot`)
- `<zip>` — path to a recording ZIP for offline analysis

## Standard workflow

```
Step 1 — discover (skip if the user already provided a PID, filter, or ZIP path)
jstall_run(["list"])
→ <pid> <main-class-or-jar>
   25409 spring-boot-language-server.jar
   83465 org.eclipse.equinox.launcher.jar

Tip: jstall_run(["list", "MyApp"]) filters by main class substring.

Step 2 — diagnose
jstall_run(["status", "--intelligent-filter", "--no-native", "<pid>"])
→ sections: uptime · gc-heap-info · vm-classloader-stats · vm-metaspace ·
            compiler-queue · most-work · threads · dependency-tree · jvm-support

Step 3 — triage the output (see decision tree below)
```

The `status` output contains everything for initial triage. Only call further commands when you need more detail. Avoid `--full` until standard `status` has been reviewed — it adds class histogram and heap detail that can produce very large output.

If unsure which flags a command accepts, call `jstall_help({command: "<name>"})` first. For subcommands use a space: `jstall_help({command: "record create"})`.

For remote JVMs replace `jstall_run` with `jstall_remote({type, target, args})` throughout.

---

## Triage decision tree

After reading `status` output, pick the branch that matches:

```
most-work shows threads with high CPU% and RUNNABLE
  → High CPU scenario

most-work shows threads with BLOCKED state
  → Lock contention scenario

most-work shows 0% CPU / all WAITING or TIMED_WAITING, app still slow
  → I/O or external wait scenario

dependency-tree has entries  OR  threads section shows BLOCKED
  → Lock contention scenario

status output contains "deadlock"
  → Deadlock scenario

gc-heap-info: Heap used% > 80%  OR  Δ growing fast
  → GC pressure / memory scenario

vm-metaspace: trend shows ↑ growing  OR  vm-classloader-stats shows growing custom loader
  → Classloader leak scenario

compiler-queue: Active compilations > 0 sustained across samples
  → JIT backlog — app may be slow at startup; usually self-resolving

jvm-support: "outdated" warning
  → Recommend JVM update; note which vendor/version and how old
```

---

## Scenarios

### Deadlock

`status` mentions deadlock in its output. Escalate:

```
jstall_run(["deadlock", "<pid>"])
→ Thread-A holds lock 0x... (java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock)
    waiting to acquire lock 0x... held by Thread-B
  Thread-B holds lock 0x...
    waiting to acquire lock 0x... held by Thread-A

jstall_run(["dependency-graph", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ ASCII graph: Thread-A → lock X → Thread-B → lock Y → Thread-A
```

Fix: establish consistent lock-acquisition ordering across all call sites, or use `tryLock(timeout)`.

### High CPU

```
jstall_run(["most-work", "--top=5", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ 1. worker-1   CPU time: 4.82s  Core utilization: 96.4%  RUNNABLE
     com.example.HotMethod.compute(HotMethod.java:42)

jstall_run(["threads", "--no-native", "--top=10", "<pid>"])
→ full thread table sorted by CPU time — use when most-work stacks aren't deep enough

jstall_run(["flame", "--output=/tmp/flame-<pid>.html", "--duration=15s", "<pid>"])
→ blocks ~15s, then saves flamegraph HTML — tell user to open in browser
```

Event options for `flame`: `cpu` (default), `alloc`, `lock`, `wall`, `itimer`.

### Lock contention (non-deadlock)

```
jstall_run(["waiting-threads", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ threads that are WAITING/TIMED_WAITING without making progress

jstall_run(["dependency-graph", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ current snapshot of lock ownership — use when contention is happening right now

jstall_run(["dependency-tree", "--intelligent-filter", "--dump-count=3", "<pid>"])
→ lock dependencies across 3 dumps — use when contention is intermittent
  and a single snapshot might miss it
```

### I/O or external wait (all threads idle, app still slow)

All `most-work` threads show 0% CPU and WAITING/TIMED_WAITING. The bottleneck is outside the JVM — network, DB, filesystem, or a downstream service.

```
jstall_run(["waiting-threads", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ look for threads stuck in socket read, JDBC, HTTP client, etc.

jstall_run(["threads", "--no-native", "--intelligent-filter", "<pid>"])
→ scan all thread stacks for blocking I/O frames (SocketInputStream.read,
  Statement.execute, HttpClient.send, etc.)

jstall_run(["flame", "--event=wall", "--output=/tmp/wall-<pid>.html",
            "--duration=15s", "<pid>"])
→ wall-clock flamegraph captures time spent waiting, not just CPU —
  shows where threads block on external calls
```

### GC pressure / memory

```
jstall_run(["gc-heap-info", "<pid>"])
→ Heap used 80,256K | 18.8%   Δ +0K   ← Δ growing rapidly = allocation-driven GC

jstall_run(["flame", "--event=alloc", "--output=/tmp/alloc-<pid>.html",
            "--duration=15s", "<pid>"])
→ allocation flamegraph — shows which call paths allocate the most

jstall_run(["status", "--full", "--no-native", "<pid>"])
→ includes heap histogram — only use when lighter status didn't surface the cause;
  output can be very large
```

### Classloader leak

```
jstall_run(["vm-metaspace", "<pid>"])
→ VM.metaspace (2 samples):
   Non-Class: 44.20 MB used  ↑ +10.24 KB used  ← growing trend = leak suspect
   Class:      6.48 MB used  → +0 bytes used

jstall_run(["vm-classloader-stats", "<pid>"])
→ Classes per classloader — large or growing counts in custom loaders = leak
```

Classloader leaks typically come from frameworks that create new classloaders (OSGi, hot-reload, scripting engines) without unloading old ones.

### Environment / health check

```
jstall_run(["jvm-support", "<pid>"])
→ JVM looks outdated based on java.version.date=2026-01-20 (4mo 19d old)
   Detected: Eclipse Adoptium 21.0.10 — Recommendation: update the JVM

jstall_run(["gc-heap-info", "<pid>"])      ← heap + GC details and Δ trends
jstall_run(["vm-metaspace", "<pid>"])      ← metaspace summary + virtual space
jstall_run(["compiler-queue", "<pid>"])    ← JIT queue depth and active compilations
jstall_run(["vm-vitals", "<pid>"])         ← VM.vitals counters (SapMachine only)
```

### Capture for offline analysis or sharing

```
jstall_run(["record", "create", "--count=3", "--interval=10s",
            "--output=/tmp/rec.zip", "<pid>"])
→ 3 samples × 10s apart → /tmp/rec.zip

jstall_run(["record", "summary", "/tmp/rec.zip"])
→ creation time, JVM list, data types captured

jstall_run(["status", "--intelligent-filter", "--no-native", "/tmp/rec.zip"])
jstall_run(["flame", "--output=/tmp/flame.html", "/tmp/rec.zip"])
```

Add `--full` to `record create` to include flamegraph, JFR recording, class histogram, and class hierarchy. Omit for a lightweight ZIP with just thread dumps and heap info.

### High system CPU (not the JVM)

```
jstall_run(["processes", "<pid>"])
→ detects other OS processes consuming high CPU alongside the JVM
  (use when OS reports high CPU but JVM threads all look idle)
```

### Remote (SSH / Cloud Foundry)

```
jstall_remote({type: "ssh", target: "user@host", args: ["list"]})
jstall_remote({type: "ssh", target: "user@host",
               args: ["status", "--intelligent-filter", "--no-native", "<pid>"]})
jstall_remote({type: "cf", target: "my-app", args: ["list"]})
jstall_remote({type: "cf", target: "my-app",
               args: ["status", "--intelligent-filter", "--no-native", "<pid>"]})
```

Remote support requires jstall on the remote host (PATH or jbang). Linux/macOS only on the remote side.

deadlock               — deadlock-only check
most-work              — threads doing the most work across dumps
flame                  — async-profiler flamegraph → HTML (blocks for --duration, default 10s)
threads                — all threads sorted by CPU time (full stacks, use after most-work)
waiting-threads        — threads waiting without progress (potentially starving)
dependency-graph       — lock dependency snapshot (active/current contention)
dependency-tree        — lock dependencies across multiple dumps (intermittent contention)
record create          — capture diagnostics ZIP; add --full for flamegraph + JFR
record summary         — print README summary from a recording ZIP
record extract         — extract recording ZIP to a folder
gc-heap-info           — GC heap details and Δ trends
vm-metaspace           — metaspace summary and virtual space
vm-classloader-stats   — classloader stats grouped by type (leak detection)
compiler-queue         — JIT queue state and active compilations
vm-vitals              — VM.vitals counters (SapMachine only)
processes              — other OS processes consuming high CPU

```

Use `jstall_help({command: "<name>"})` for full flag reference. Subcommands use a space: `jstall_help({command: "record create"})`.

**Notes:** Java 17+ required to run jstall (target JVM can be 11+). `flame` blocks for `--duration` (default 10s). `target="all"` runs in parallel across every JVM — output is separated by `====== PID ... ======` headers.
