# JStall

[![CI](https://github.com/parttimenerd/jstall/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/parttimenerd/jstall/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Maven Central Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/me.bechberger/jstall)](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/me.bechberger/jstall) [![JetBrains Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/jetbrains/plugin/v/30667-jstall.svg)](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/30667-jstall)

**JStall answers the age-old question: "What is my Java application doing right now?"**

JStall is a small command-line tool for **one-shot inspection** of running JVMs using thread dumps and short, on-demand profiling.

Features:
* **Deadlock detection**: Find JVM-reported deadlocks quickly
* **Hot thread identification**: See which threads are doing the most work
* **Thread activity categorization**: Automatically classify threads by activity (I/O, Network, Database, etc.)
* **Dependency graph**: Visualize which threads wait on locks held by others
* **Starvation detection**: Find threads waiting on the same lock with no progress
* **Intelligent stack filtering**: Collapse framework internals, focus on application code
* **Offline analysis**: Analyze existing thread dumps
* **Flamegraph generation**: Short profiling runs with [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler)
* **Smart filtering**: Target JVMs by name/class instead of PID
* **Multi-execution**: Analyze multiple JVMs in parallel for faster results
* **JVM support checks**: Warn if the target JVM is likely out of support (based on `java.version.date` from `jcmd VM.system_properties`)
* **Supports Java 11+**: Works with all modern Java versions as a target, but requires Java 17+ to run
* **Record & Replay**: Record diagnostic data for later analysis or sharing as a zip file
* **Minimal Builds Available**: There are minimal builds (< 250 KB) available that exclude the bundled async-profiler ([SapMachine](https://sap.github.io/SapMachine/) ships with it anyway) and are optimized via [femtojar](https://github.com/parttimenerd/femtojar).
* **Remote JVMs**: via `-s "ssh user@host" COMMAND` or via `--cf APP COMMAND` for cloud-foundry
* **Live Mode**: Interactive TUI with `--live` for continuous monitoring with sorting, filtering, and color
* **Top threads filtering**: Use `--top=<n>` to show only the top N threads by CPU time (e.g., `jstall threads --top=5 --live <pid>`)

Requires Java 17+ to run.

You can use the `jstall` CLI tool directly, or through the
[IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/30667-jstall) or
[VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bechberger.jstall) (with MCP support).

## Installation

Download the latest executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/parttimenerd/jstall/releases).

Or use with [JBang](https://www.jbang.dev/): `jbang jstall@parttimenerd/jstall <pid>`

## Quick Start

**Example:** Find out what your application (in our example `MyApplication` with pid `12345`) is doing right now

```bash
# Quick status check (checks for deadlocks and hot threads)
jstall 12345

# Or explicitly run the status command, that also supports using JVM name filters
jstall status MyApplication

# Find threads consuming most CPU
jstall most-work 12345

# Monitor all threads in live mode
jstall threads --live 12345

# Monitor top 5 threads in live mode
jstall threads --top=5 --live 12345

# Detect threads stuck waiting on locks
jstall waiting-threads 12345

# Show thread dependency graph (which threads wait on which)
jstall dependency-tree 12345

# Generate a flamegraph
jstall flame 12345

# Record diagnostic data for later analysis or sharing
jstall record 12345 --output myapp-diagnostics.zip

# Run status analysis on the recorded data
jstall -f myapp-diagnostics.zip status all

# Which is equivalent to
jstall status myapp-diagnostics.zip
```

All analysis commands also support the special target `all` to analyze every discovered JVM (or every recorded JVM in replay mode): `jstall status all` or `jstall -f myapp-diagnostics.zip status all`.

### Global Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|----------|
| `-f, --file=<zip>` | Replay mode from a recording ZIP |
| `-s, --ssh=<prefix>` | Run commands on remote host via SSH (e.g., `ssh user@host`) |
| `--cf=<app>` | Cloud Foundry remote execution (shortcut for `--ssh 'cf ssh <app> -c'`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Verbose logging of remote commands |

### Filtering and Multi-Execution

Use **filter strings** to match JVMs by main class name instead of PIDs:

```bash
jstall list MyApp              # List matching JVMs
jstall status MyApplication    # Analyze matching JVMs
jstall deadlock kafka          # Check deadlocks in matching JVMs
```

**How it works:** Filter strings match main class names (case-insensitive). When multiple JVMs match, they're analyzed **in parallel** with results sorted by PID.

**Note:** `flame` requires exactly one JVM (fails if filter matches multiple).

## Commands

For full command reference with all options, see [docs/COMMANDS.md](docs/COMMANDS.md).

- `-f, --file=<zip>` — Replay mode from a recording ZIP
- `--no-native` — Ignore threads without stack traces

**Exit codes:**
- `0` = no issues
- `1` = no JVMs found (for `list`)
- `2` = deadlock detected
- `10` = JVM is totally outdated (> 1 year)

---

### `status` (default)

Runs deadlock detection, most-work, threads, dependency-graph, and dependency-tree over shared thread dumps. Requires at least 2 dumps.

Also performs a **JVM support check**: collects `java.version.date` from `jcmd VM.system_properties` and warns if the JVM is > 4 months old (exit code 10 if > 1 year old).

```bash
jstall status 12345
jstall status MyApplication --top 5 --intelligent-filter
jstall status all --full
```

---

### `most-work`

Shows CPU time, CPU percentage, core utilization, state distribution, and activity categorization for top threads.

```bash
jstall most-work 12345 --top 5 --stack-depth 15 --intelligent-filter
```

---

### `waiting-threads`

Finds threads stuck waiting on the same lock instance across all dumps with no CPU progress (WAITING/TIMED_WAITING, CPU ≤ 0.0001s).

```bash
jstall waiting-threads 12345 --intelligent-filter
```

---

### `dependency-graph`

Shows which threads wait on locks held by others, detects dependency chains, and categorizes threads by activity.

**Example Output:**
```
Thread Dependency Graph
======================

[I/O Write] file-writer
  → [Network] netty-worker-1 (lock: <0xBBBB>)
     Waiter state: BLOCKED, CPU: 2.10s
     Owner state:  BLOCKED, CPU: 5.20s

Dependency Chains Detected:
---------------------------
Chain: [Database] jdbc-connection-pool → [I/O Write] file-writer → [Network] netty-worker-1
```

---

### `flame`

Generates a flamegraph using [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler). Filter must match exactly one JVM.

```bash
jstall flame 12345 --duration 15s --output flame.html
jstall flame MyApp --event alloc --duration 20s --open
```

Events: `cpu`, `alloc`, `lock`, `wall`, `itimer`

---

### `compiler-queue`

Analyzes JIT compiler queue state over time using `jcmd Compiler.queue`.

```bash
jstall compiler-queue 12345
```

---

### Live Mode

Monitor a JVM continuously with an interactive TUI (Linux/macOS only):

```bash
jstall status 12345 --live
jstall status MyApp --live --color
jstall threads 12345 --live 
```

> **Note:** `--live` requires a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, or WSL). It is not available on Windows.

**Features:**
- Async data collection (UI stays responsive)
- Tab navigation between analyzers (Tab/Shift-Tab)
- Sort by column (`1-9`), secondary sort (`s` then `1-9`)
- Filter rows (`/`)
- Adjust collection interval (`+`/`-`), force refresh (`r`)
- Colored output with `--color` (green=RUNNABLE, red=BLOCKED, yellow=WAITING, CPU% intensity)
- Scroll (`j`/`k` or arrows), horizontal pan (`h`/`l`)
---

## Recording & Replay

Record diagnostic data for later analysis or sharing:

```bash
jstall record 12345 -o myapp-diagnostics.zip
jstall record all -o full-system.zip --full   # includes expensive jcmd commands
```

Replay on any machine:

```bash
jstall status myapp-diagnostics.zip
jstall -f myapp-diagnostics.zip threads all
jstall record summary myapp-diagnostics.zip
jstall record extract myapp-diagnostics.zip ./output-folder
```

---

## Thread Activity Categorization

JStall automatically categorizes threads by their activity based on stack trace analysis:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Network Read/Write | Socket operations, accept calls |
| Network | Selectors, polling, Netty |
| I/O Read/Write | File input/output operations |
| Database | JDBC and SQL operations |
| External Process | Waiting on external processes |
| Lock Wait | Waiting on locks/monitors |
| Sleep | Thread.sleep() calls |
| Park | LockSupport.park() calls |
| Computation | Active computation |
| Unknown | Unrecognized activity |

---

## Intelligent Stack Trace Filtering

Use `--intelligent-filter` to collapse framework internals and focus on application code.

```bash
jstall most-work 12345 --intelligent-filter --stack-depth 15
```

**Before:**
```
at com.example.MyController.handleRequest(MyController.java:42)
at jdk.internal.reflect.GeneratedMethodAccessor123.invoke(Unknown Source)
at jdk.internal.reflect.DelegatingMethodAccessorImpl.invoke(...)
at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Method.java:566)
at org.springframework.web.method.support.InvocableHandlerMethod.invoke(...)
```

**After:**
```
at com.example.MyController.handleRequest(MyController.java:42)
... (3 internal frames omitted)
at org.springframework.web.method.support.InvocableHandlerMethod.invokeForRequest(...)
at com.example.Service.processRequest(Service.java:78)
```

## AI-Powered Analysis (Experimental)

> **Note:** AI analysis is experimental and hidden from the default CLI help. Commands are available via direct invocation.

JStall includes an AI command that sends thread dump data to an LLM for natural-language analysis. It supports remote (Gardener) and local (any OpenAI-compatible server) providers.

```bash
jstall ai 12345                          # analyze a JVM with default provider
jstall ai 12345 --local                  # force local provider
jstall ai 12345 --model gpt-4            # override model
jstall ai 12345 --question "Is there a deadlock?"
jstall ai full                           # analyze all JVMs on the system
```

### Configuration

Create a `.jstall-ai-config` file in the current directory or home directory:

**Remote (Gardener):**
```properties
provider=gardener
model=gpt-50-nano
api.key=your-api-key
```

**Local OpenAI-compatible server** (llama-server, vLLM, LocalAI, etc.):
```properties
provider=local
local.host=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

**Auto-launch llama-server** — if `llama-server` is installed and no server is running, JStall can launch one automatically with a HuggingFace model:
```properties
provider=local
local.host=http://127.0.0.1:8080
local.llama-server-model=AaryanK/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF:Q8_0
```

The server is started in the background with the specified model and stopped when JStall exits. Model files are cached in `$HF_HOME` (defaults to `~/.cache/huggingface`).

### AI Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--local` | Force local OpenAI-compatible provider |
| `--remote` | Force remote Gardener provider |
| `--model <name>` | Override LLM model |
| `--question <q>` | Custom question (use `-` for stdin) |
| `--think` | Show thinking/reasoning tokens (local provider only) |
| `--short` | Produce a succinct summary |
| `--raw` | Output raw JSON response |
| `--dry-run` | Show prompt without calling AI |
| `--no-tools` | Disable tool calling (enabled by default for local providers) |

### Tool Calling (Interactive Analysis)

When using a local OpenAI-compatible provider, tool calling is **enabled by default**. The LLM first receives the `jstall status` summary, then can use tools to dig deeper into specific threads or issues it wants to investigate further.

```bash
jstall ai 12345 --local                  # tools enabled automatically
jstall ai 12345 --local --no-tools       # disable tools, just summarize
jstall ai 12345 --tools --remote         # explicitly enable tools with remote provider
```

Available tools the AI can use:
- **get_thread_stack_trace** — full stack trace of a thread (optionally from a specific dump)
- **search_stack_frames** — find threads with a class/method in their stack
- **get_lock_info** — lock holders and blocked threads
- **get_top_cpu_threads** — top N threads by CPU consumption
- **get_dependency_tree** — thread wait chains (who blocks whom)
- **compare_thread_across_dumps** — track a thread across multiple dumps to see if it's stuck
- **get_system_properties** — JVM configuration and properties
- **get_raw_thread_dump_section** — raw dump text for a specific thread

The AI makes up to 5 tool-call rounds before producing its final answer. Progress is shown on stderr (e.g., `[tool 1/5] get_thread_stack_trace(thread_name=main)`).
